why would i use class components over functional componenets?

Functional components uses less code but the benefit of use class components is one they extend beyond the component and use state itself within the components. This is beneficial in many ways because i uses
stateful logic and the lifecycle method can be use inside the component.




Name three lifecycle methods and their purpose?
Mounting, updating and unmounting!

Mounting is the first phase of the lifecycle and it happens in an instance of a components being created and inserted into the DOM itself.
updating is caused by changes that happens when updates happen to props or to state.
and unmounting happens when a component is done with evenything is has to do. 


What s the purpose of a custom hook??
The purpose is to improve the ability to share logic acoross components. Each time we use custom hooks we isolate all state and the effects inside.


why is it important to test our app??

its important to test our apps to make sure bugs doesn't happen before our application is lauched. We want to make sure that our application isrunning as smooth as possible.
